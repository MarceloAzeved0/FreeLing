  If you got FreeLing in a .tar.gz, .rpm, .deb, or any other packaging
  system, you don't need to read further. Just ignore this file.

  If you checked out FreeLing from a CVS for the first time, you will 
  probably need to issue the following commands:

   libtoolize
   aclocal
   autoconf
   automake -a


  Also, you will need to install Omlet+Fries libraries.
  They are available from http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/omlet+fries,
  both in source tarball or from CVS.


  Then, you can normally issue:

    configure && make && make install 


  For more details on this, refer to CVS and automake manuals
