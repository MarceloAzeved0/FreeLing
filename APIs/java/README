  ##### Java API for Freeling  ######


  This directory contains a jarfile with a generated java API for FreeLing.
  Setting it in your CLASSPATH (after making sure freeling libraries are
  properly installed) should do the trick.

  If you experience problems, you may want to re-generate the API
  following the instructions below:


  INSTALLATION

  To get a java API library, after installing Freeling library, follow the steps:

  1.- Edit Makefile in this directory to adjust the right values of
       FREELING_DIR = directory prefix where you installed freeling, omlet,
                      and fries (probably /usr/local)
       LIBS_DIR = directory where FreeLing required libraries (pcre, Berkeley DB) 
                  are installed, which contains lib and include directories
                  (probably /usr/local if you compiled the libraries, or /usr if 
                   you installed them from distribution packages)
       SWIG_DIR = directory where swig share files are installed in your system
                  (e.g. /usr/local/share/swig/1.3.29)

   2. Check if your swig version includes "std_list.i" template for java 
       (it should be in $SWIG_DIR/java/std_list.i)
      If the file is not included, copy the std_list.i provided here to
      the directory $SWIG_DIR/java 

   3. Copy the std_string.i provided in this directory to 
      $SWIG_DIR/java in your swig installation, overwriting the 
      original file installed by swig.

       **WARNING**    If you use swig to generate java APIs for libraries 
       **WARNING**    other than FreeLing, you probably want to keep the
       **WARNING**    original swig configuration, so, make sure to backup
       **WARNING**    the original std_string.i for java before overwriting 
       **WARNING**    it with the version provided here.

       ***** IMPORTANT WARNING ****   The modifications to swig file std_string.i
       ***** IMPORTANT WARNING ****   provided here are experimental.
       ***** IMPORTANT WARNING ****   Use them to your own risk. Report errors, please.

   4. issue 'make' to build the java API

   5.  Make sure that the directory contanining libmorfo.so ($FREELING_DIR/lib) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       Make sure that the directory contanining libmorfo_java.so (just created by make) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

   6.  Make sure that the path to package "libmorfo_java.jar" created by make is in your CLASSPATH
 
   7.  compile and execute the sample program: 
         javac analyzer.java
         java analyzer

   See FreeLing documentation and sample programs in src/main to understand what this sample program is doing.


   NOTES

    This java API for FreeLing includes also a java API for Fries. 
    So, you can call any of the both libraries using this module.

    Neverthless, if you want to use only Omlet and/or Fries, you don't need to use 
    the whole FreeLing API. 
    Packages for Omlet+Fries include their own java API to access the services 
    of these libraries.
