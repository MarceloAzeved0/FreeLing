  ##### Perl API for FreeLing  (experimental)  ######


  INSTALLATION

  To get a perl API library, after installing FreeLing, follow the steps:

  1.- Edit Makefile in this directory to adjust the right values of
        FREELINGDIR: must be your FreeLing installation directory --e.g. /usr/local
        LIBSDIR: must be the directory where libdb_cxx and libpcre are found --e.g. /usr/local or /usr/local/mylibs
        PERLDIR: must be the libraries directory of your local perl installation --e.g /usr/local/perl-5.8.0/lib/5.8.0/i686-linux

   3. issue 'make' to compile the perl API

   4.  Make sure that the directories contanining libdb_cxx.so and libpcre.so (LIBSDIR) are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       Make sure that the directory contanining libmorfo.so (FREELINGDIR/lib) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

   5.  Test the interface with the "sample.perl" script in this directory 
       (after editing it to adjust FREELINGDIR)

   6.  To use the perl API from any other perl script, put the files "libmorfo.pm" and "libmorfo_perl.so" in some perl @INC directory, or appropriately set your PERL5LIBS environment variable.
 


   USAGE

    - Write your perl programms using freeling as seen in sample.perl
    - Current perl API does not support tree templates, so you can not
      get a FreeLing parse tree into perl... :-(
