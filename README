FreeLing: Natural language analysis libraries
=============================================

The FreeLing package consists of a library providing language analysis
services (such as morfological analysis, date recognition, PoS
tagging, etc.)

The current version (2.0) of the package provides tokenizing, sentence
splitting, morphological analysis, NE detection and classification,
recognition of dates/numbers/physical magnitudes/currency/ratios, PoS
tagging, shallow parsing, dependency parsing, and WN-based sense
annotation. Future versions are expected to improve performance in 
existing functionalities, as well as incorporate new features, such
as word sense disambiguation, document classification, anaphora resolution, etc.

The distributed version includes the following morphological
dictionaries. Although the dictionaries for some latin languages may
seem small, it must be taken into account that many more forms than
those in the dictionary are reconginzed thanks to a powerful suffix
analysis module able to detect enclitic pronoun verbal forms and
diminutive/augmentative suffixed nouns and adjectives.

  * The English dictionary was automatically extracted from
WSJ, with minimum manual post-edition, and thus may be a little noisy.
It contains over 160,000 forms corresponding to some 102,000 different
combinations lemma-PoS.</li>

  * The Spanish and Catalan dictionaries are hand build, and contain the 6,500 most frequent open-category lemmas for each language, plus all closed-category lemmas. The Spanish and Catalan dictionaries try to maintain the same coverage (that is, the same lemmas are expected to appear in both dictionaries).
  The Spanish dictionary contains over 81,000 forms corresponding to more than 7,100 different combinations lemma-PoS, and the Catalan dictionary contains near 67,000 forms corresponding to more than 7,400 different combinations lemma-PoS.
  Spanish and catalan dictionaries are expected to cover over 80%  of open-category tokens in a text. For words not found in the dictionary, all open categories are assumed, with a probability distribution based on word suffixes, and the tagger makes a choice based on most likely tag sequence.

  * Italian dictionary contains over 355,000 forms corresponding to over 36,000 lemma-PoS combinations.

  * Galician dictionary contains more than 90,000 forms, corresponding to near 7,400 lemma-PoS combinations.


This version also includes WordNet-based sense dictionaries for languages which it is available for:

 * The English sense dictionary is straightforwardly extracted from WN 1.6 and therefore is distributed under the terms of WN license. You'll find a copy in the LICENSE.WordNet file.

 * The Catalan and Spanish sense dictionaries are extracted from EuroWordNet, and the reduced subsets included in this FreeLing package are distibuted under Gnu LGPL, as the rest of the code and data in this package. Find a copy of the license in the COPYING file.

1. Requirements
---------------

 To install FreeLing you'll need:

 * A typical Linux box with usual development tools:
    
     bash
     make
     C++ compiler with basic STL support (e.g. g++ version 3.x)    

 * Enough hard disk space (about 40Mb)

 * Some external libraries are required to compile FreeLing:

       [pcre] (version 4.3 or higher)
               Perl C Regular Expressions. Included in most
               usual Linux distributions. Just make sure
               you have it installed.
               Also available from http://www.pcre.org

       [db] (version 4.1.25 or higher)
               Berkeley DB. Included in all usual
               Linux distributions. You probably 
               have it already installed. Make sure of it, and that
               C++ support is also installed (may come in a separate
               package).  
               Also available from http://www.sleepycat.com. Do
               not install it twice unless you know what you are doing.

       [libcfg+] (version 0.6.1 or higher)
               Configuration file and command-line options
               management. May not be in your linux distribution.
               Available from http://www.platon.sk/projects/libcfg+,
               follow installation instructions provided in the libcfg+ package.

       [Omlet & Fries] (omlet v.0.95 or later, fries v.0.91 or later)
               Machine Learning utility libraries, used by Named
               Entity Classifier. Installation scrips are not very
               clever yet, so these libraries are required even if you do
               not plan to use the NEC ability of FreeLing.
               Available from http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/omlet+fries

   Note that you'll need both the binary libraries and their source headers
   (in some distributions the headers come in a separate package tagged -devel, e.g.
   the libpcre library may be distributed in two packages: the first,
   say libpcre-4.3.rpm, contains the binary libraries, and the second,
   say libpcre-devel-4.3.rpm, provides the source headers)

   Note also that if you (or the library package) install those libraries
   or headers in non-standard directories (that is, other than /usr/lib
   or /usr/local/lib for libraries, or other than  /usr/include or 
    /usr/local/include for headers) you may need to use the  CPPFLAGS
   or  LDFLAGS variables to properly run  ./configure script.

    For instance, if you installed BerkeleyDB from a  rpm
   package, the  db_cxx.h file may be located at 
   /usr/include/db4 instead of the default  /usr/include.
   So, you'll have to tell  ./configure where to find it:
    ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include/db4' 

    The BerkeleyDB package is probably installed in your system, but 
   you may need to install C++ support, which (depending on your
   distribution) may be found in a separate package (such as
   db4-cxx.rpm, db4-cxx-devel.rpm, or the like).

   See next section and INSTALL file for further details.

2. Installing from SVN
-----------------------

  if you got this package from the SVN repository, issue the commands:

   aclocal
   libtoolize
   autoconf
   automake -a

  Then, proceed to step 3 (Installation)


3. Installation
---------------

Installation follows standard GNU autoconfigure installation
procedures. See the file INSTALL for further details.

The installation consists of a few basic steps:

 * Decompress the FreeLing-1.3.tgz package in a temporary subdirectory.
   Issue the commands:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

 The last command may be issued as root.

 You may control the installation defaults providing appropriate
 parametres to the  ./configure script. The command: 

   ./configure --help  

   will provide help about installation options (e.g. non-default
   installation directory, non standard locations for required
   libraries, etc.) 

 The INSTALL file provides more information on standard installation 
 procedures.

4. Executing
------------

  FreeLing is a library, which means that it is a tool to develop 
new programs which may require linguistic analysis services. 

  Nevertheless, a simple main program is included in the package for
 those who just want a text analyzer. This small program may easily
 be adapted to fit your needs (e.g. customized input/output formats).
  
  Chapter 2 in the user manual describes usage of this sample main
  program.
  The user manual is found in the /usr/local/share/FreeLing/doc/userman
  directory after FreeLing installation, or in the doc/userman directory after 
  decompressing the tar.gz distribution package.


5. Porting to other platforms
-----------------------------

The FreeLing library is entirely written in C++, so it should be
possible to compile it on non-unix platforms with a reasonable
effort (additional pcre/db/cfg+ libraries porting might be 
required also...). 

Success have been reported on compiling FreeLing on MacOS, as well as on
MS-Windows using cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/).
