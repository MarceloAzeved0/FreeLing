  FreeLing was originally written by people in TALP Research 
  Center at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (http://talp.upc.es). 

  Spanish and Catalan linguistic data were originally developed 
  by people in CLiC, Centre de Llenguatge i Computacio at Universitat
  de Barcelona (http://clic.fil.ub.es).

  Many people further contributed to by reporting problems, suggesting 
  various improvements, submitting actual code or extending linguistic 
  databases. Here is a list of these people. Help us keep it complete 
  and exempt of errors.

  --- Begin of List ----

  2004

  >> Montserrat Civit (civit@clic.fil.ub.es) developed the 
     shallow parsing grammars for Spanish and Catalan.

  2005

  >> Mikel Forcada and the InterNostrum 
     team (http://www.internostrum.com) in Universitat d'Alacant 
     (http://www.dlsi.ua.es) completed the Spanish and Catalan
     dictionaries to cover the same lemas in both languages, enlarging
     the dictionaries from 5,000 to 6,500 lemmas.

  >> TALP and CLiC research centers, who developed the 
     Catalan WordNet, granted the distribution of the synsets
     for the 6,500 most frequent lemmas.

  >> The feature extraction module is based on the code developed by 
     Dan Roth's Cognitive Computation Group at University of Illinois 
     at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), who we thank for allowing us to distribute
     our modified version under GPL.
     More info at:  http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/
     ** This module is no longer distributed as part of FreeLing, but separately 
     ** as the Fries library (http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/omlet+fries)

  >> TALP and CLiC research centers and Natural Language Processing 
     researchers at UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educacion a 
     Distancia, http://nlp.uned.es), who developed the Spanish 
     WordNet, granted the distribution of the synsets for the 6,500
     most frequent lemmas.

  >> The English WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory 
     at Princeton University under the direction of Professor George A. Miller.
     Synset information is included in FreeLing under the original WordNet 
     license terms (see COPYING file).
     See http://wordnet.princeton.edu for more details on WordNet

  >> The Italian dictionary is extracted from Morph-it! lexicon developed by 
     Marco Baroni and his colleagues at the Scuola Superiore di Lingue 
     Moderne per Interpreti e Traduttori (SSLMIT, http://www.ssit.unibo.it/) 
     of the University of Bologna. These data are included in this package under
     their original Creative Commons license (See COPYING file).

  >> The Galician dictionary was obtained from the OpenTrad project 
     (http://www.opentrad.org), and was developed by Xavier Gómez Guinovart and
     the members of the Seminario de Lingüística Informática (http://sli.uvigo.es)
     at Universidade de Vigo. These data are included in this package under
     their original Creative Commons license (See COPYING file).

  2006

  >> Jordi Atserias managed to compile FreeLing-1.4 for Windows using cygwin.

  >> Montserrat Marimon contributed in debugging and improving several parts 
     of the Spanish linguistic data. 

  >> Gorka Labaka, Mikel Lersundi, and Aingeru Mayor from IXA group 
     (http://ixa.si.ehu.es) at Basque Contry University contributed 
     with a lot of testing and suggestions on the Named Entity recognizer, 
     the chunker, and the dependency parsing module.

  >> The Spanish Industry Ministry funded part of FreeLing development through
     the OpenTrad project (http://www.opentrad.org)

  2007

  >> Javier Puche extended the Java API to support access to parse and dependeny trees
 
  >> Bruno Martinez made valuable bugfixing and the necessary changes
     to enable FreeLing compilation on 64-bit architectures.

  >> The Spanish dictionary was obtained from the Spanish Resource Grammar
     (http://www.upf.edu/pdi/iula/montserrat.marimon/srg.html)
     project developed by Montserrat Marimon at the Institut
     Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada (http://www.iula.upf.edu)
     of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. These data are included in this 
     package under their original Lesser General Public License For 
     Linguistic Resources (LGPLLR) license (see COPYING file).

  >> The Spanish Education and Science Ministry funded part of
     FreeLing development through the KNOW project (http://ixa.si.ehu.es/know)

  >> The Spanish Industry Ministry funded part of FreeLing development 
     through the EuroOpenTrad project (http://www.opentrad.org)

  2008

   >> Jordi Carrera, Marina Lloberes, and Irene Castellón from GRIAL research group extended and improved dependency and shallow parsing grammars for Catalan, Spanish and English.

   >> Francis Tyers, Apertium developer at Prompsit, provided morphological and PoS tagging data sets for Welsh.

   >> Vitalie Scurtu wrote the Italian number recognizer module.

   >> Daniel Berndt and Gemma Boleda debbuged and extended the English dictionary.

   >> Daniel Berndt extended the functionalities of the basic NE recognizer.

   >> Dmitry Vitkovsky largely improved the efficiency of the tokenizer speeding 
      up the whole analysis chain.

   >> The Spanish Industry Ministry funded part of FreeLing development 
      through the EuroOpenTrad project (http://www.opentrad.org)

   >> Pablo Gamallo and Marcos Garcia, from Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,
      enlarged the Galician dictionary and retrained the Galician PoS taggers with
      a larger corpus, improving its accuracy.
