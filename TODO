  TO-DO list for FreeLing

   * Improve suffix retokenization for ambiguous cases (e.g. "dar+se")


   * Improve perl, python and Java APIS created with SWIG. 

   * add native UTF-8 support (is it worth?)

   * Add language identifier

   * Improve chart_parser API to allow the incremental use of different grammars.
     After an analysis, the grammar can be changed and further analysis performed:
     either continuing from the status reached by the previous step, or from
     a "freezed" image in which a parsing has been selected and fixated.

   * Train NE classifiers for all languages but Spanish

   * Develop and train ML-based NE recognizers

   * Develop dependency rules for all languages but Spanish

   * Improve capabilities of dependency parsing rule description language

   * Create dates_en and dates_it classes to recognize English and Italian date/time
     expressions

   * Create accents_ca class, to deal with catalan 
     accentuation in suffixing. Have a look to
     accents_es to understand the idea.

   * Create quantitites_en and quantitites_it classes, to deal with
     ratio expressions in English and Italian. Have a look at
     quantities_es to get an idea.
