  This directory contains a main program which interfaces the 
  LKB HPSG environment to freeling library

  For more information about LKB and related stuff, see

  If you want to use FreeLing output from inside the LKB, follow these steps:

  1) Make sure you have installed the 'uniconv' unicode conversion tool. 
     It is found in a package called 'yudit'

  2) Compile the interface program:
      cd src
      edit LKBMakefile and adjust the three first lines to your installation:
        FREELINGDIR=base directory where you installed FreeLing (default /usr/local)
        MYINCLUDES=non-default directories where includes for required libraries can be found 
                   (e.g. in some distributions, db_cxx.h may be installed in /usr/include/db4)
        MYLIBS=non-default directories where required libraries can be found 
                (e.g. if you installed libcfg+ in somewhere other than /usr/local/lib)

      compile the program with 'make -f LKBMakefile'
      cd ..

  3) once back to this directory (src/main/LKB in FreeLing package), you'll find three files
     you want to keep:
       LKBanalyzer
       LKB.cfg
       sppp

     you can move them to somewhere in your user directory. They are your LKB-FreeLing interface
     (specially the 'sppp' file)
  
  4) edit LKB.cfg and replace all occurrences of FREELINGDIR with the actual base directory 
     where you installed FreeLing  (default /usr/local)

  5) Nothing else on FreeLing part.  
     Now follow the instructions given in LKB doc on how to 
     call external analyzers (http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbSppp)

     Basically, you have to modify the LKB config file --with the appropriate path to sppp--

       (setf *sppp-application* "/path/to/my/sppp")

     And in the load script of your grammar, include

       (initialize-sppp)

     Then, your gramar has to include inflection rules to deal with the tags that
     FreeLing will provide, and from here onwards, everything is regular LKB stuff.
