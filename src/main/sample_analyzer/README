 **** ANALYZER.CC ****

  The first, "analyzer.cc" is an exhaustive main program that allows the 
 user to control all parameters and configuration files provided to the 
 library, and to choose different kinds of I/O formats.
  This program is provided as a sample, as well as a main program to access
 the analisys library for those who just want a ready-to-use analyzer.
  The used options are controlled via configuration file, or via
 command-line options.

  See user manual for details on the available options

 SCRIPTS
 -------

 **** ANALYZE ****

 This script just calls analyzer.cc, and so, it accepts the same command
 line options.

 The only differences are:

 1.- The -f option (configuration file) does not need to be the full path 
    of an existing file. If the file is not found, it is searched in 
    share/FreeLing/config under FreeLing installation directory.

 2.- You don't need to properly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since the script will 
    try to locate FreeLing libraries


 **** ANALYZE.UTF ****

 This script just calls analyzer.cc, and so, it accepts the same command
 line options.

 The only differences are:

 1.- The -f option (configuration file) does not need to be the full path 
    of an existing file. If the file is not found, it is searched in 
    share/FreeLing/config under FreeLing installation directory.

 2.- You don't need to properly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since the script will 
    try to locate FreeLing libraries

 3.- The input is assumed to be in UTF-8, and so the 'uniconv' utility is
    used to convert it before calling the analyzer. The analyzer output 
    is also converted back to UTF-8.
