 **** ANALYZE.SERVER ****

 This script just calls analyzer.cc, and so, it accepts the same command
 line options.

 The only differences are:

 1.- The -f option (configuration file) does not need to be the full path 
    of an existing file. If the file is not found, it is searched in 
    share/FreeLing/config under FreeLing installation directory.

 2.- The script expects the first argument to be a basename with which 
    two named pipes (basename.in and basename.out) are created.
     The analyzer is launched to read from basename.in and write
    to basename.out

     This provides simple but efficient way to call the analyzer from
    other programs without having to link the library, and without 
    having to launch and load the analyzer for each file to be processed.
