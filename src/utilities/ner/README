  This directory contains information about how to train a NE Recognizer for FreeLing.
  Read the comments in the TRAIN.sh script.

  In fact, the libraries being used here is not FreeLing, but Omlet&Fries
  (www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/omlet)

  Before training, you'll have to compile train.cc and lexicon.cc with the commands:

  g++ -o train train.cc -lomlet -lpcre -lfries
  g++ -o lexicon lexicon.cc -lpcre -lfries

  You may need to add -I and -L options if your libraries
  (libomlet.so, libfries.so, libpcre.so) are not in a default location.
