       manipulation" section

       float-like style
     * fixed matching empty prefixes of short and/or long command
       line options
     * tiny fixes in building stuff mostly related to
       documentation

   version 0.6, October 9, 2002 (official release)

     * brand new man pages are generated from SGML (DocBook)
       documentation and they were added into libcfg+
       distrubution

     * documentation update

   version 0.5.2, July 19, 2002 (official release)

     * important API changes to get better libcfg+ parsing
       context creation functions; parameter argc and end_pos are
       not used in standart context creation functions, parameter
       size is used instead; if you already use libcfg+, please
       make following substitutions:
          + cfg_get_cmdline_context() function call for
            cfg_get_cmdline_context_argc()
          + cfg_set_cmdline_context() function call for
            cfg_set_cmdline_context_argc()
          + cfg_get_cfgfile_context() function call for
            cfg_get_cfgfile_context_pos()
          + cfg_set_cfgfile_context() function call for
            cfg_set_cfgfile_context_pos()
     * all elements are now counted from 0 to get analogical
       behaviour in command line array items, configuration file
       bytes and configuration file lines; in fact, this issue
       affects only configuration file lines, which was counted
       from 1 till this change
     * fixed bug with property cleaning
     * various virtual properties added for setting up two or
       more real properties in one function call
     * improved internal functions split_multi_arg() and
       unquote_single_arg()
     * example is now installed with documentation
     * documentation update

   version 0.5.1, Juny 11, 2002 (official release)

     * unnecesary file props.h removed due to linking problems
       against installed shared library; linking now works fine
     * (special) properties stuff completely rewritten; three new
       functions and cfg_property_type enumeration added, ugly
       macros removed
     * working example added to distribution
     * installation and documentation building stuff improvements
     * documentation update

   version 0.5, May 24, 2002 (official release)

     * initial release
